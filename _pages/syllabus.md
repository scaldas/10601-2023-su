### Syllabus

 ***

##### **Course Description**
Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that automatically improve their performance through experience, e.g., programs that learn to recognize human faces, recommend music and movies, and drive autonomous robots. 

This course covers the theory and practical algorithms for machine learning from a variety of perspectives. Specific topics include Bayesian networks, decision trees, support vector machines, statistical learning methods, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning as well as theoretical concepts such as inductive bias, the PAC learning framework, Bayesian learning methods, margin-based learning, and Occam’s Razor. Programming assignments include hands-on experiments with various learning algorithms. 

This course is designed to give a graduate-level student a thorough grounding in the methodologies, technologies, mathematics and algorithms currently needed by people who do research in machine learning.

10-301 and 10-601 are identical. Undergraduates must register for 10-301 and graduate students must register for 10-601.

##### **Learning Outcomes**

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

- Implement and analyze existing learning algorithms, including well-studied methods for classification, regression, structured prediction, clustering, and representation learning.
- Integrate multiple facets of practical machine learning in a single system: data preprocessing, learning, regularization and model selection.
- Describe the formal properties of models and algorithms for learning and explain the practical implications of those results.
- Compare and contrast different paradigms for learning (supervised, unsupervised, etc...).
- Design experiments to evaluate and compare different machine learning techniques on real-world problems.
- Employ probability, statistics, calculus, linear algebra, and optimization in order to develop new predictive models or learning methods.
- Given a description of a ML technique, analyze it to identify (1) the expressive power of the formalism; (2) the inductive bias implicit in the algorithm; (3) the size and complexity of the search space; (4) the computational properties of the algorithm: (5) any guarantees (or lack thereof) regarding termination, convergence, correctness, accuracy or generalization power.

##### **Prerequisites**

Students entering the class are expected to have a pre-existing working knowledge of probability, linear algebra, statistics and algorithms; some recitation sessions will be held to review basic concepts.

1. You need to have, before starting this course, significant experience **programming** in a general programming language. Specifically, you need to have written from scratch programs consisting of several hundred lines of code. For undergraduate students, this will be satisfied for example by having passed 15-122 (Principles of Imperative Computation) with a grade of ‘C’ or higher, or comparable courses or experience elsewhere.

Note: For each programming assignment, you will be required to use **Python**. You will be expected to know, or be able to quickly pick up, that programming language.

2. You need to have, before starting this course, basic familiarity with **probability and statistics**, as can be achieved at CMU by having passed 36-217 (Probability Theory and Random Processes) or 36-225 (Introduction to Probability and Statistics I), or 15-359, or 21-325, or comparable courses elsewhere, with a grade of ‘C’ or higher.
3. You need to have, before starting this course, college-level maturity in **discrete mathematics**, as can be achieved at CMU by having passed 21-127 (Concepts of Mathematics) or 15-151 (Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science), or comparable courses elsewhere, with a grade of ‘C’ or higher.

You must strictly adhere to these pre-requisites! Even if CMU’s registration system does not prevent you from registering for this course, it is still your responsibility to make sure you have all of these prerequisites before you register.
